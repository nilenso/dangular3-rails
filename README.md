# Dangular3::Rails

This is the asset pipeline gem for nilenso/dangular3.
This also bundles bullet.js which is a dependency for the bullet_graph_directive.

To customize the d3 graphs, use the assets in `dangular3` instead of this.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'dangular3-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dangular3-rails

## Usage

Add the following in `application.js` after requiring `angular.js` and `d3.js`

    //= require line_graph_directive
    //= require bar_graph_directive
    //= require bullet
    //= require bullet_graph_directive
